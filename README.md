# Red Dead Redemption 2 - PC Photomode extractor

Download [here](https://github.com/Ivan-Malinovski/rdr2-photomode-extractor/releases)

This program extracts your photomode pictures from your save games folder and converts them to jpg. Simply run the executable and a folder with your images will appear.

If you have your save games folder in a weird location, create a new txt-file called rdr2dir.txt, that contains the path to the Profiles folder. This should be unnecessary for the vast majority of people.

If you want a custom location for the images, create a txt-file called photodir.txt that contains the path you want to have the images extracted to. Make sure to end the path with a backslash.

# Troubleshooting
## What do I need to run this?
Nothing, everything needed is included in the executable. That's basically the only reason I made this fork.

Have fun

## Credits

All the hard work was done by Manuelsc on GitHub, including some of the readme. I only made the program an executable, and added a couple of features, for the purpose of making it more user-friendly.
